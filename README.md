# Krait
A new graph prompt-as-trigger backdoor attack.

Our attack targe—All-in-One has been wrapped into a package called [ProG](https://github.com/sheldonresearch/ProG). The problem is, the results of their new package are different from what we have used in their old version. Their updated package provides new functions and a new logic to run the whole experiments.

The old version and our code will be provided very soon. If you are interested in our research and want to reproduce it recently, please feel free to contact me via yis121@pitt.edu. Thank you!
